Version 1.0

* Many API changes compared to pre-1.0 versions:
    - rename adapt_integrate -> hcubature
    - integrand now returns int to signal errors
    - error_norm argument for vector-valued integrands
    - maxeval and npt args are now size_t, not int

* New pcubature routines for p-adaptive (Clenshaw-Curtis) integration.

* Split test.c and some #include stuff from hcubature.c (to share
  with pcubature.c).
